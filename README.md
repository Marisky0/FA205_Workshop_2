# FA205_Workshop_2
In this workshop we learned about time intervals and recursive functions. I then used this new knowledge to add to my previous ghost sketch so I can control the timing of the ghosts.

## Problem Solving 
I was able to successfully add the time interval into my previous sketch but I ran into a slight problem.

In the future I'm going to try more complex ideas, perhaps I can see how I can control the timming of different objects so that they appear at different times.
